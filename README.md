# Cadence-extensions

### [iWF](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf) as a DSL framework on top of Cadence. 
**I am now focusing on this iWF project :)**

iWF is an all-in-one platform for developing long-running business processes. It offers a convenient abstraction layer for utilizing databases, ElasticSearch, message queues, durable timers, and more, with a clean, simple, and user-friendly interface.

iWF is a versatile WorkflowAsCode engine that is both simple and powerful. By utilizing Cadence/Temporal as an interpreter on the backend, iWF preserves all the capabilities of Cadence/Temporal, while maintaining the same level of scalability and reliability.




### **SQL Plugin: SQLite**

[Here](https://github.com/longquanzheng/cadence-extensions/tree/master/cadence-sqlite) implements SQL persistence with SQLite. Tested locally.
